# Types of numbers

I learnt different types of numbers in cs 

I really can't call these numbers special since one set of numbers are called special numbers by itself

## Types:

- Armstrong number: the sum of cube of digits of a number n is equal to the number n

    Example: 153 
            
    $153 = 1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 153$

- Palindrome number: reverse of number n is same as n

    Example: I have some tenacity in life. Hope you guys can make numbers by yourself :)

- Perfect number: the sum of the factors of the number n except itself is equal to the number n

    Example: 6

    Factors of 6 except itself is 1, 2, 3. Adding them up will be 6

- Special number: the sum factorials of digits of number n is equal to the number n

    Example: 145

    $145 = 1! + 4! + 5! = 1 + 24 + 120 = 145$

That's all the different numbers for now. The code to check these numbers is in the repo. Feel free to check it out :)
